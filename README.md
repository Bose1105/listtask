# listtask



## Getting Started

1. Within Build context , every time argument is called so that the list reset is happening when scrolled

2. First We created CountWidgtController for statemanagement

3. Create the list with controller variable (listCountWidget) in initState method which will create N number of widgets

4. In ListItemWiget we have updated the count using index to controller value (CountWidgtController)

5. Then we got the value from controller list
